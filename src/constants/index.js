export const HERO_CONTENT1 = `Welcome to my portfolio website! I’m still building this website as I go, so it’s currently under development which is why it probably looks so bland. A little about me, my name is Tony and I am a 16-year-old high schooler from Temecula, California.`;
 
export const HERO_CONTENT2 = `I play Go (in my opinion a really difficult board game) and started learning in 2016, currently rated AGA 7D. Over the years, I’ve acquired a few accolades in Go, placing 3rd overall in the 38th World Youth Go Championship, 1st in both the 2022 and 2023 U.S. Go Congress in the Open Section, and 2nd in the senior division of the Redmond Cup. Aside from playing Go, I also enjoy helping the Go community and helping grow the game in America. I co-founded my high school’s Go Club, I taught Go at a local Chinese School as a volunteer and I currently teach at the San Diego Go Club every Tuesday night. Earlier this year, I published an app called ScribeGo on the App Store which makes learning from professional Go games more efficient. For the past eight-ish months, my fellow co-author Han Han and I have recently finished writing our book “The Theory of Go” out on Amazon, and we would really appreciate it if you could check it out on the “My Book” tab at the top :)`;

export const HERO_CONTENT3 = `Besides Go, I am also passionate about math and programming. I love competitive math, and I’ve competed in competitions such as the AMC, and recently I’ve been getting into mathematical modeling and research. I don’t have the most experience with programming, but I am familiar with C++, Swift, Java, and Python, and I enjoy building projects and competing in programming competitions. Outside of my busy life, I enjoy playing piano, tennis, basketball, ping pong, listening to music, and watching movies/shows.`;
